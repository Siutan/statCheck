# StatCheck

A simple tool to view your or others match history in League of Legends, sort of like op.gg but with less features.
Initially made to mess around with Tauri and Svelte, but as im adding more features, might make it into something more useful.

## How to run
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Run Tauri Dev 
yarn tauri dev
```
